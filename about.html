        <p class="p1">Welcome to my photography website! My name is Cem Bazarbasi and I am a passionate photographer based in the beautiful San <p class="p11">Francisco Bay Area, but my journey started in Turkey, where I was born and raised.</p></p>
       <p class="p2">  My love for photography began in 2011 when I got my first camera. I immediately became fascinated by the art of capturing moments and expressing emotions through images. I decided to delve deeper into the world of photography and focused on honing my skills in street photography.   
      <br><br> During my exploration of street photography, I had the incredible opportunity to join a workshop led by the renowned photographer in Adana, Murat Gunaydin. The workshop was centered around street and documentary photography, and the experience was truly transformative. A documentary photograph taken during the workshop was even published, which further fueled my passion for this art form.    
      <br><br> Inspired by my time with Murat Gunaydin, I became an instructor assistant in his photography workshop. Assisting and mentoring aspiring photographers was a rewarding experience that allowed me to share my knowledge and passion with others. 
      <br><br> In my photography journey, I have had the privilege of receiving recognition for my work. One significant achievement was winning the Orange Blossom Festival Photo Competition. It was a humbling experience to have my work recognized and celebrated.       
      <br><br> In 2023, I embarked on a new chapter in my photography career, exploring the breathtaking beauty of national parks alongside my beloved wife. Being surrounded by nature fuels my creativity and allows me to capture its wonders through my lens. These adventures in the wilderness have inspired me to document and share the awe-inspiring moments I've encountered during long hikes in these stunning landscapes.       
      <br><br>  I am passionate about sharing my experiences and photographs with the world, and I would truly appreciate your support. If you would like to contribute to my upcoming visiting journeys to national parks, your generous donations would go a long way in helping me continue capturing and publishing the beauty of nature.       
      <br><br>  Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope my photographs bring you joy and inspire you to see the world through a different lens.</p>
