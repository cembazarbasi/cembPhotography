            <h6 class="description">This is a newly started collection of US National Park photography prints for sale by the photographer Cem Bazarbasi showcasing wonder of America's National Parks.
            The United States has 62 US National Parks that are operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior.
            National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress.
            A bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872 followed by Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890.
            The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein,
            and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." 
            Criteria for the selection of national parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities.</h6>
